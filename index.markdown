<h2><em>Welcome to the Liu Lab!</em></h2>
We are a computational biology team dedicated to understand the aberrations carried in the genome that could cause cancer in the kids. We develop state-of-the-art computational tools to analyze sequencing data of genome, transcriptome and epigenome. At the same time, we are extensively collaborating with the doctors in SCMC and across China to translate not only our findings but also our approaches to assist clinical management of patients. Besides the dry lab, our team has also set up the bench for cell and molecular biology experiments. So we are a multi-deciplined group with one unified aim to find cures for the kids!  

Our lab is located in Shanghai Children's Medical Center (SCMC), affiliated with Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine. We have several open positions for different levels. Join us if you want to make a difference in pediatric cancer treatment!
