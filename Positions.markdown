<h2>Open positions</h2>
We are always looking for highly motivated and creative graduate students, Postdocs or Assistant Professors to join us to explore the unknowns in pediatric cancer genomics together. We provide in the lab a multi-desciplined and highly collaborative enviroment. Working closely with our clinical team in Department of Heamatology and Oncology at SCMC, we are translating our research to bedside in real time. If you were interested in studying the genomic aberrations by developing computational tools and reanalyzing the large and unique dataset available right now in the lab, or if you were interested in understanding the fundamental biology of the nominated driver aberrations by combining the computational analysis and high throughput cell and molecular biology experiments, or if you were interested in precision medicine and want to translate your work to make a difference in clinic, you are welcomed to join our team! Experience with computational biology or genomic analysis is a plus but not mandatory. Reach out today and send your most updated CV with a one-page research plan to us (yu.liu@sjtu.edu.cn).
