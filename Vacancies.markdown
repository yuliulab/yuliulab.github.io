<h3><em>Open positions</em></h3>
We are always looking for highly motivated and creative Postdocs or Assistant Professors to join us to explore the genomic aberrations in pediatric cancer. We provided a highly cooperative team work enviroment in the lab. By collaborating with our clinic team from Department of Heamatology and Oncology at SCMC, we are studying and translating our findings in real time. If you are interested in studying the driver genomic aberrations uncovered by developing computational tools and reanalyzing the large dataset available right now in the lab, or by combining the computational analysis and molecular biology experiments to start a new angel, or if you are interested in precision medicine and want to translate our work to make a difference in clinic, please give it a try in our lab by sending your most updated CV with a one page research plan to me (yu.liu@sjtu.edu.cn).
